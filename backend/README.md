# Backend for Admin Features

This backend application is designed to support the admin features of the project. It is built using TypeScript and Express, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing admin-related operations.

## Project Structure

The backend is organized into the following directories and files:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - **app.ts**: Entry point of the application. Initializes the Express app and sets up middleware and routes.
  - **controllers/**: Contains the `adminController.ts` which handles admin-related requests.
  - **routes/**: Contains the `adminRoutes.ts` which defines the routes for admin features.
  - **models/**: Contains the `adminModel.ts` which defines the structure of admin data and database interactions.
  - **services/**: Contains the `adminService.ts` which includes business logic for admin features.
  - **types/**: Contains the `index.ts` which defines the types used throughout the application.

- **package.json**: Lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- **tsconfig.json**: Configuration file for TypeScript.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- The backend exposes various endpoints for admin operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting admin records.
- Ensure that the frontend is configured to communicate with the backend API endpoints defined in `adminRoutes.ts`.
